## 1. Introduction

This article explains how the heat generated during incineration inside the incinerator is transferred 
to the air curtain, thereby simultaneously carrying out the incineration and combustion processes.

## 2. Key Factors

- Thermal decomposition by high temperature
- Progress of combustion and incineration
- Unnecessary secondary combustion chamber

## 3. Putting Waste into the incinerator

This incinerator requires that waste be fed into the top of the incinerator. The ash discharging pot 
at the bottom of the incinerator must remain closed during incineration. 
This means that if the incinerator lid is closed, waste must be fed through a separate waste inlet 
located in the lid. 

Furthermore, the amount of waste fed during incineration cannot exceed 
the height of the primary air nozzle located below the central air injection pipe.

## 4. Thermal decomposition by high temperature

Waste fed into the incinerator undergoes pyrolysis initially due to the high temperature 
within the first stage of the air injection pipe, 
starting from the bottom of the incinerator and reaching the air nozzle.

This differs from the concept of "pyrolysis," which occurs without oxygen. The combustible, 
low-molecular-weight gases and vapors generated during the pyrolysis process 
rapidly combust beneath the second stage air curtain.

## 5. No need for a secondary chamber

Unlike incinerators that typically require a secondary chamber, this incinerator handles 
both combustion and incineration processes simultaneously within a single incinerator, 
eliminating the need for a separate secondary chamber.

## 6. Complete Combustion at High Temperatures

The high temperatures generated during incineration (800-1200 degrees Celsius) 
do not emit environmentally hazardous substances.

Complete combustion requires not only sufficiently high temperatures, but also sufficient time 
for combustion gases to remain in the high-temperature region (typically more than 2 seconds), 
and turbulence to ensure smooth mixing of fuel and oxygen. 

When these three conditions(3T's) are met simultaneously, complete removal of hazardous substances 
is possible without black smoke or unpleasant odors.

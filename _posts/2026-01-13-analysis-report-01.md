## 1. Introduction

This article explains how the heat generated during incineration inside the incinerator is transferred 
to the air curtain, thereby simultaneously carrying out the incineration and combustion processes.

## 2. Key Factors

- Thermal decomposition by high temperature
- Progress of combustion and incineration
- Unnecessary secondary combustion chamber

## 3. Putting Waste into the incinerator

Initial results indicate that optimized airflow
significantly improves heat utilization.

## 4. Putting Waste into the incinerator

Initial results indicate that optimized airflow
significantly improves heat utilization.

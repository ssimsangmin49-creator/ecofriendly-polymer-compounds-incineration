## 1. Introduction

This article explains how the heat generated during incineration inside the incinerator is transferred 
to the air curtain, thereby simultaneously carrying out the incineration and combustion processes.

## 2. Key Factors

- Flue gas temperature
- Heat exchanger design
- Residence time

## 3. Preliminary Observations

Initial results indicate that optimized airflow
significantly improves heat utilization.

## 1. Introduction

This article explains how the heat generated during incineration inside the incinerator is transferred 
to the air curtain, thereby simultaneously carrying out the incineration and combustion processes.

## 2. Key Factors

- Thermal decomposition by high temperature
- Progress of combustion and incineration
- Unnecessary secondary combustion chamber

## 3. Putting Waste into the incinerator

This incinerator requires that waste be fed into the top of the incinerator. The ash discharging pot 
at the bottom of the incinerator must remain closed during incineration. 
This means that if the incinerator lid is closed, waste must be fed through a separate waste inlet 
located in the lid. 

Furthermore, the amount of waste fed during incineration cannot exceed 
the height of the primary air nozzle located below the central air injection pipe.

## 4. Thermal decomposition by high temperature

Waste fed into the incinerator undergoes pyrolysis initially due to the high temperature 
within the first stage of the air injection pipe, 
starting from the bottom of the incinerator and reaching the air nozzle.

This differs from the concept of "pyrolysis," which occurs without oxygen. The combustible, 
low-molecular-weight gases and vapors generated during the pyrolysis process 
rapidly combust beneath the second stage air curtain.

## 1. Introduction

This blog post introduces a method for collecting and incinerating marine waste using large vessels.
This method also utilizes an incinerator, which exhibits excellent incineration performance 
despite its moisture content, to collect, sort, dehydrate, and incinerate large quantities of marine waste.

## 2. Key Factors

- Separation, deodorization, and crushing of marine waste
- Eco-friendly incineration of high-moisture marine waste
- Incinerator Controls

## 3. Shredding, deodorization and separation of marine waste

<span style="color:#1e40af; font-weight:bold;">
Incineration of large quantities of marine debris involves collection, shredding, dehydration, and metal removal.

To minimize the amount of ash remaining after incineration, bottles are shredded to remove metals, 
but the only remaining pieces of broken glass are later discharged along with the ash. 
However, the number of glass bottles floating in the ocean is very small.

## 4. Change in waste input method

The Push & Pull type waste inlet on the side of the incinerator is operated by the control system.

## Control system, dust collection, etc

Controlling multiple incinerators connected in parallel on large vessels involves 
a combination of individual incinerator control and overall system control, 
including dust collection equipment. This area requires system development for field testing.

On a vessel with a structure like the one shown in the image, it would be possible 
to install dust collection equipment on the deck structure, connected to the chimneys on both sides. 
This also requires expert design and field testing.

Of course, the image shows that the upper part of the incinerator is open, but in operation, 
the upper part of the incinerator needs to be sealed or have an opening and closing structure.

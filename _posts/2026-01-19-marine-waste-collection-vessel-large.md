## 1. Introduction

This blog post introduces a method for collecting and incinerating marine waste using large vessels.
This method also utilizes an incinerator, which exhibits excellent incineration performance 
despite its moisture content, to collect, sort, dehydrate, and incinerate large quantities of marine waste.

## 1. Introduction

This blog post introduces a method for collecting and incinerating marine waste using large vessels.
This method also utilizes an incinerator, which exhibits excellent incineration performance 
despite its moisture content, to collect, sort, dehydrate, and incinerate large quantities of marine waste.

## 2. Key Factors

- Separation, deodorization, and crushing of marine waste
- Eco-friendly incineration of high-moisture marine waste
- Incinerator Controls

## 3.  Shredding, deodorization and separation of marine waste

Incineration of large quantities of marine debris involves collection, shredding, dehydration, and metal removal.

To minimize the amount of ash remaining after incineration, bottles are shredded to remove metals, 
but the only remaining pieces of broken glass are later discharged along with the ash. 
However, the number of glass bottles floating in the ocean is very small.

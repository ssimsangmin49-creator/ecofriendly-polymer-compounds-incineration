Application to WTE(Waste-to-Energy)-02

## Introduction to Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Applications

### Concept of WTE (Waste to energy) using heat exchangers

This paper describes a WTE model utilizing a heat exchanger. 
First, this model operates two sets of incinerators, each representing a set of two units, 
depending on the desired power generation capacity.

### WTE using a heat exchanger dedicated to PP and PE

A dedicated WTE system for PP and PE utilizing a heat exchanger can be constructed.  
This system is similar to the WTE system using a steam boiler, except that the steam boiler is replaced with a heat exchanger.

Because the WTE sector is often the subject of conflicting theories and opinions, 
this section will focus solely on the concept of recycling the heat generated by incinerating polymer compounds.

The overall design process encompasses a significant area of ​​engineering.

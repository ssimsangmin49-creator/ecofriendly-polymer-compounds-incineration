Application to WTE(Waste-to-Energy)-01

## Introduction to Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Applications

This blog post will explain, with diagrams, the most basic method for operating 
a Waste-to-Energy (WTE) facility using the incinerator introduced in this blog. 
However, this guide was written with consideration given the limited capacity 
of the incinerator being introduced.

First, we will introduce a WTE facility dedicated to polymer compound incineration, 
equipped with a 2MW steam boiler-based power generation facility.

The WTE facility is equipped with all waste input devices and dust collection facilities after the incinerator.

## Incinerator Size

Incinerators used in WTE for polymer compound incineration should be 
at least 1,500 mm in diameter (2,000 or 2,500 mm recommended). 
Parallel operation of multiple incinerators is recommended. 

This ensures sufficient heat generation. Connecting two or more incinerators 
in parallel ensures continued operation in the event of one incinerator failure.

### Parallel connection of incinerators

This blog assumes that two incinerators larger than 1500 mm are connected in parallel 
to incinerate polymer compounds.

### Method of feeding waste into an incinerator

- Glass bottles, cans, and stones are sorted and removed from the waste fed into the incinerator,
  the waste is crushed in a shredder, and then loaded onto a conveyor belt

- Glass bottles, cans and rocks are the only materials that cannot be incinerated in this incinerator

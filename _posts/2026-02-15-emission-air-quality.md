## Stack Gas Quality – Thermal Treatment Process (SGS Method)

This note summarizes three emission air quality analysis reports obtained from stack gas sampling during controlled thermal treatment operation. The purpose of this document is to provide a technical overview of emission characteristics, combustion stability, and preliminary Dioxin/Furan (TEQ) performance under real operating conditions.

### 1. Combustion and Process Conditions

Measured parameters indicate a stable excess-air oxidation regime:
- Stack temperature: approx. 260–277 °C
- Oxygen (O₂): ~11–12.5 %
- Gas flow rate: approx. 4,300 Nm³/hr
- Opacity: 0.0

The relatively high residual oxygen level suggests lean combustion conditions with sufficient air supply. The absence of visible opacity implies low soot formation and effective oxidation during thermal treatment.

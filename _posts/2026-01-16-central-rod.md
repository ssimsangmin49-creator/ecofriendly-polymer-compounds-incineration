About the fabrication and installation of the Central Rod...

## Introduction

This section covers the manufacturing and installation of the central rod. 
First, it's important to note that the central rod is closely related to 
the diameter of the incinerator. 

Therefore, the diameter, length, and perforation steps of the central rod vary 
depending on the size of the incinerator.

## Key factors

- Number of layers of air nozzles
- Number of air nozzles per layer
- What metal pipe is suitable for the Central Rod?

## Composition of the Central Rod

The central rod consists of a cap, a body, a three- or four-stage air nozzle, 
and an air intake at the bottom.

### Air nozzle

The air nozzles perforated in each layer can be perforated in two stages, as shown in the image. 
This is to facilitate heat circulation within the incinerator. 
Alternatively, the perforation angle of the air nozzles may need to be adjusted.

### Cap screw machining

The cap is necessary for cap screw machining when opening the cap to clean 
the inside of the rod or repair a clogged air nozzle.

## Metal material of the central rod

The metal material of the central rod is susceptible to thermal oxidation due to the high temperatures 
generated during incineration (average temperatures exceeding 850 degrees Celsius). 

Therefore, the pipe must be made of a metal material resistant to thermal oxidation. 
However, a cost analysis should be conducted to compare this with the use of multiple metal pipes made of general metal.

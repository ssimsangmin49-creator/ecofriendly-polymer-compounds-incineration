About the fabrication and installation of the Central Rod...

## Introduction

This section covers the manufacturing and installation of the central rod. 
First, it's important to note that the central rod is closely related to 
the diameter of the incinerator. 

Therefore, the diameter, length, and perforation steps of the central rod vary 
depending on the size of the incinerator.

## Key factors

- Number of layers of air nozzles
- Number of air nozzles per layer
- What metal pipe is suitable for the Central Rod?

## Composition of the Central Rod

The central rod consists of a cap, a body, a three- or four-stage air nozzle, 
and an air intake at the bottom.

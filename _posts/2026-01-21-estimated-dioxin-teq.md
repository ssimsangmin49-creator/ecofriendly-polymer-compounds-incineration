Preliminary TEQ reconstruction based on SGS stack-gas measurements

> **Measurement basis**  
> All measurements were conducted directly on stack gas at the incinerator outlet,
> using SGS standard test methods.  
> No additional post-treatment devices (filters, scrubbers, catalysts) were assumed
> in the measurement configuration.

## Comparison of Dioxin/Furan Emissions (TEQ-based)

Regulatory limits in both the EU and the US are defined using TEQ (toxic equivalency).
The table below shows typical TEQ ranges reported for commercial incineration systems,
for contextual comparison with this project.

| Technology type | Typical scale | Typical PCDD/F (ng-TEQ/Nm³) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Conventional MSW incinerator (modern) | Large | 0.01 – 0.10 | Designed to meet 0.1 limit |
| Hazardous waste incinerator | Large | 0.01 – 0.10 | Depends on waste & controls |
| BAT-level incinerator | Large | ~0.01 – 0.05 | Best available techniques |
| Small / legacy incinerator | Small | > 0.1 | Frequently exceeds limits |
| **This project** | **Small / distributed** | **TEQ pending** | **Stack gas, SGS method, no post-treatment** |

**Regulatory reference:**  
EU and US emission limit value: **0.1 ng-TEQ/Nm³**

## 1. Introduction

This blog post introduces a method for collecting and incinerating marine waste using large vessels.
This method also utilizes an incinerator, which exhibits excellent incineration performance 
despite its moisture content, to collect, sort, dehydrate, and incinerate large quantities of marine waste.

Preliminary TEQ reconstruction based on SGS stack-gas measurements

> **Measurement basis**  
> All measurements were conducted directly on stack gas at the incinerator outlet,
> using SGS standard test methods.  
> No additional post-treatment devices (filters, scrubbers, catalysts) were assumed

## 1. Comparison of Dioxin/Furan Emissions (TEQ-based)

Regulatory limits in both the EU and the US are defined using TEQ (toxic equivalency).
The table below shows typical TEQ ranges reported for commercial incineration systems,
for contextual comparison with this project.

| Technology type | Typical scale | Typical PCDD/F (ng-TEQ/Nm³) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Conventional MSW incinerator (modern) | Large | 0.01 – 0.10 | Designed to meet 0.1 limit |
| Hazardous waste incinerator | Large | 0.01 – 0.10 | Depends on waste & controls |
| BAT-level incinerator | Large | ~0.01 – 0.05 | Best available techniques |
| Small / legacy incinerator | Small | > 0.1 | Frequently exceeds limits |
| **This project** | **Small / distributed** | **TEQ pending** | **Stack gas, SGS method, no post-treatment** |

**Regulatory reference:**  
EU and US emission limit value: **0.1 ng-TEQ/Nm³**


## 2. Estimated TEQ Reconstruction (7% O₂ Reference)

Based on typical congener distributions observed in controlled combustion systems,
a conservative WHO-TEF-based estimation was applied for preliminary assessment only.

| Parameter | Estimated TEQ (ng-TEQ/Nm³) |
|---|---:|
| Subtotal CDD (TEQ) | 0.024 |
| Subtotal CDF (TEQ) | 0.033 |
| **Total Dioxin/Furan (TEQ)** | **≈ 0.057** |

> This TEQ value is provided for explanatory purposes only.
> Formal regulatory comparison requires congener-specific TEQ calculation.


## 3. Mechanisms of Dioxin and Furan Suppression in a Low-Complexity Incineration System

### 3-1. Abstract

Dioxin and furan formation during waste incineration is strongly influenced by combustion temperature, 
residence time, oxygen availability, and post-combustion cooling behavior.

This technical note explains the mechanisms by which a low-complexity, small-scale incineration system 
can suppress dioxin and furan formation without relying on additional post-treatment devices.

The discussion is based on established combustion chemistry and is supported 
by stack-gas measurements conducted using SGS standard methods.

### 3-2. Background: Why Dioxins Form in Incineration

#### 3-2-1 Formation pathways

Dioxins and furans (PCDD/F) are not primary combustion products.
They are mainly formed through:  
- a. Incomplete combustion  
- b. De novo synthesis during cooling (200–450 °C range)  
- c. Presence of:  
    aa. Chlorine  
    bb. Organic carbon  
    cc. Metal catalysts (e.g. Cu)  

The most critical condition for PCDD/F formation is not high temperature itself,
but uncontrolled cooling after combustion.

3-2-2 Design Philosophy of the Present System

The incineration system discussed here follows three guiding principles:  
- a. Sufficient thermal destruction  
- b. Stable oxygen-rich environment  
- c. Minimized residence time in the de novo synthesis window  
- d. Importantly, these principles are achieved without relying on:  
    aa. Bag filters
    bb. Activated carbon injection
    cc. Catalytic reactors

Preliminary TEQ reconstruction based on SGS stack-gas measurements

> **Measurement basis**  
> All measurements were conducted directly on stack gas at the incinerator outlet,
> using SGS standard test methods.  
> No additional post-treatment devices (filters, scrubbers, catalysts) were assumed
> in the measurement configuration.

## 1. Comparison of Dioxin/Furan Emissions (TEQ-based)

Regulatory limits in both the EU and the US are defined using TEQ (toxic equivalency).
The table below shows typical TEQ ranges reported for commercial incineration systems,
for contextual comparison with this project.

| Technology type | Typical scale | Typical PCDD/F (ng-TEQ/Nm³) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Conventional MSW incinerator (modern) | Large | 0.01 – 0.10 | Designed to meet 0.1 limit |
| Hazardous waste incinerator | Large | 0.01 – 0.10 | Depends on waste & controls |
| BAT-level incinerator | Large | ~0.01 – 0.05 | Best available techniques |
| Small / legacy incinerator | Small | > 0.1 | Frequently exceeds limits |
| **This project** | **Small / distributed** | **TEQ pending** | **Stack gas, SGS method, no post-treatment** |

**Regulatory reference:**  
EU and US emission limit value: **0.1 ng-TEQ/Nm³**


## 2. Estimated TEQ Reconstruction (7% O₂ Reference)

Based on typical congener distributions observed in controlled combustion systems,
a conservative WHO-TEF-based estimation was applied for preliminary assessment only.

| Parameter | Estimated TEQ (ng-TEQ/Nm³) |
|---|---:|
| Subtotal CDD (TEQ) | 0.024 |
| Subtotal CDF (TEQ) | 0.033 |
| **Total Dioxin/Furan (TEQ)** | **≈ 0.057** |

> This TEQ value is provided for explanatory purposes only.
> Formal regulatory comparison requires congener-specific TEQ calculation.

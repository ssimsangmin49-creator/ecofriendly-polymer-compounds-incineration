## 1. Introduction

This blog post presents a relatively inexpensive and convenient way to utilize 
this thermal treatment technology in low-income countries.

## 2. Key Factors

- Composition of the chamber body using refractory bricks
- Use of solar energy
- No need lid. Open thermal treatment is possible

## 3. Composition of the chamber body using refractory bricks

### 3-a. Refractory Brick Manufacturing

- Specifications of the Manufacturing Chamber: Diameter: 1000mm, Height: 1300mm
- Minimum Required Quantity: 560PCS

### 3-b. Conceptual diagram of a 1000mm chamber using refractory bricks

- The number of refractory bricks loaded is 20
- Unlike the image, each stage must be loaded at a different angle

### 3-c. Conceptual diagram of a 1000mm chamber using Solar pannel & Dust collxctor

- This image is a concept image. Detailed data on solar panels and dust collectors
  must be compiled from accurate data on related technologies.

## 4. No need lid. Open thermal treatment is possible

The thermal treatment of waste by the structure of this chamber can be operated 
by simply loading the waste from the top without installing an chamber lid 
in low-income countries where administrative regulations such as dust collection facilities are not enforced.

Emission air quality tests were completed on the air emitted during the thermal treatment process 
without the use of post-thermal treatment equipment, including additional dust collection systems. 

The results indicate that open thermal treatment is feasible unless the addition of dust collection 
and post-thermal treatment equipment is administratively mandated.

However, what is required here is to test the air quality from uncovered thermal treatment chambers 
in more locations and in different environments and to accumulate the results.

## 1. Introduction

This incineration technology can simultaneously collect and incinerate marine waste
in an environmentally friendly manner. 

This blog post introduces a method for collecting and incinerating marine waste 
simultaneously using an incinerator that achieves excellent incineration performance 
despite a certain moisture content.

## 2. Key Factors

- Types of marine waste that can be incinerated
- Eco-friendly incineration of high-moisture marine waste
- Incinerator Controls

## 3. Types of marine waste that can be incinerated

Simply put, all the waste floating on the ocean can be incinerated, 
with the exception of things like clogged glass bottles and butane gas canisters.

## 4. Eco-friendly incineration of high-moisture marine waste

Unlike batch incinerators, this incinerator can continuously feed waste 
into the upper part of the incinerator, and can sufficiently incinerate 
marine waste with a high moisture content (waste with a moisture content of about 80%) 
after a slight dehydration process.

Most polymer compounds have very low water content. Therefore, simply shaking off the moisture 
on the surface of the collected polymer compounds will suffice for incineration 
in this type of incinerator. 
In this area, it is also crucial to expand quantitative data after implementation.

Considering the ocean environment, a bag filter-type dust collector was installed. 
This area also requires data collection on the results of field tests to improve its structure and performance.

## Incinerator controls

Control of the operation of each incinerator is possible through the control box on the deck 
and the control system installed in the cabin, allowing for independent or mixed operation.

## 1. Introduction

This incineration technology can simultaneously collect and incinerate marine waste
in an environmentally friendly manner. 

This blog post introduces a method for collecting and incinerating marine waste 
simultaneously using an incinerator that achieves excellent incineration performance 
despite a certain moisture content.

## 2. Key Factors

- Types of marine waste that can be incinerated
- Eco-friendly incineration of high-moisture marine waste
- Incinerator Controls

## 3. Types of marine waste that can be incinerated

<span style="color:#1e40af; font-weight:bold;">
Simply put, all the waste floating on the ocean can be incinerated, 
with the exception of things like clogged glass bottles and butane gas canisters.

## 4. Eco-friendly incineration of high-moisture marine waste

Unlike batch incinerators, this incinerator can continuously feed waste 
into the upper part of the incinerator, and can sufficiently incinerate 
marine waste with a high moisture content (waste with a moisture content of about 80%) 
after a slight dehydration process.

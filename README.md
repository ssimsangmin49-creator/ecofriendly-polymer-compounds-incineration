# ecofriendly-polymer-compounds-incineration
Let's collaborate on appropriate technologies to incinerate polymer compounds in an environmentally friendly manner and establish standards!
If you have ideas, data, or field observations, please use the Issues tab to share them.

## Why non-commercial testing?
Polymer incineration involves complex technical,
environmental, and social considerations.

Commercial approaches tend to be expensive,
model-limited, and slow to spread due to economic constraints.

This project promotes non-commercial fabrication
and testing so that many groups can independently
build, test, and evaluate the technology.

Open and repeated testing across different locations
is essential for trust, improvement, and eventual standards.
